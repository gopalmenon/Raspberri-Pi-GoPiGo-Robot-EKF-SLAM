{"name":"Raspberri Pi GoPiGo Robot EKF SLAM","tagline":"EKF SLAM software for Raspberry Pi based GoPiGo robot","body":"### Title\r\nThis is an implementation of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM ) using a Raspberry Pi based GoPiGo robot that is sold by [Dexter Industries](http://www.dexterindustries.com) in kit form. The robot has two powered wheels and a third castor wheel. It is equipped with an ultrasonic range finder that is mounted on a servo mechanism that allows the range finder to be pointed in any direction in front of the robot.\r\n\r\n### Teaser\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### What\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
